		<h1>The Beginner's Cheatsheet</h1>
		<p>Starting with web development it means that you probably suck at everything, just like I do. So, other than learn what makes web development possible–HTML & CSS basically–you also have to be proficient using a text editor, a version control system and the shell commands. And if you suck at all these things like I do (damn, why didn't I learn this in school?) you need to start from the very beginning, and you need to keep a file next to you until everything you do on an editor or on the terminal becomes so familiar you just do it automatically. I work with TextMate on MacOSX–the key bindings are the same, which makes it easier for me–and GIT.</p>
